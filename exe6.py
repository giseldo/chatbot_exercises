# ELIZA II: Extracting key phrases
# The really clever thing about ELIZA is the way the program appears to understand what you told it by occasionally
# including phrases uttered by the user in its responses.
# In this exercise, you will match messages against some common patterns and extract phrases using re.search().
# A dictionary called rules has already been defined, which matches the following patterns:
#     "do you think (.*)"
#     "do you remember (.*)"
#     "I want (.*)"
#     "if (.*)"

# Inspect this dictionary in the Shell before starting the exercise.

# Instructions

# Iterate over the rules dictionary using its .items() method, with pattern and responses as your iterator variables.
# Use re.search() with the pattern and message to create a match object.
# If there is a match, use random.choice() to pick a response.
# If '{0}' is in that response, use the match object's .group() method with index 1 to retrieve a phrase.

rules = {'I want (.*)': ['What would it mean if you got {0}',
                        'Why do you want {0}',
                        "What's stopping you from getting {0}"],
        'do you remember (.*)': ['Did you think I would forget {0}',
                                "Why haven't you been able to forget {0}",
                                'What about {0}',
                                'Yes .. and?'],
        'do you think (.*)': ['if {0}? Absolutely.', 'No chance'],
        'if (.*)': ["Do you really think it's likely that {0}",
                    'Do you wish that {0}',
